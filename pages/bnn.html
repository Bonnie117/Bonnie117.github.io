Neural networks are a class of machine learning algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain. It is used to model complex patterns in datasets with multiple hidden layers and non-linear activation functions.  </p>

    An artificial neural network consists of node layers, containing an input layer, hidden layer(s), and an output layer. Each node (neuron) has an associated weight and activation function. It takes an input and outputs an activation, which is passed onto the next layer. Neural networks rely on training data to improve their performance over time. There are generally 2 ways of training a neural network: 1) feedforward: flowing in one direction only, from input to output 2) backpropagation: move in the opposite direction, from output to input. Most NNs are feedforward, but we can also train NN through a combination of both feedforward and backpropagation. binarized neural networks (BNN) are similar to regular feedforward neural networks (NN). One difference is that the weights and activations in a BNN are constrained to be only two values: 1 and -1, hence the name “binarized”.
